# 🧠 LLM System Prompts Repository

This repository contains the **full system prompts** of four major large language models (LLMs):

- `ChatGPT System Prompt.txt`
- `Claude System Prompt.txt`
- `Perplexity System Prompt.txt`
- `Gemini System Prompt.txt`

Each file includes the system-level instructions that guide the model’s behavior, capabilities, and interaction design. These prompts offer insight into how each company defines the scope, personality, and control structure of their AI.
